Zonder Technical Challenge- Nasa Epi API--
First thing I would thank Demi and Zonder Studios for giving me this very good opportunity to explore more about React Native.
I really loved the journey of learning things.From my previous Experience I just used an api and tried to fetch  values and 
parsed them to achieve my goal.The Api's were pretty much straightforward which I uesd previously.But the challenge which I faced here in
using Nasa's Epi API where I had to generate urls from the API and tried to fetch data.But after a thorough understanding gained from 
Nasa's API docummentation.I tried to do it by setting a simple for loop.The rest of the assignment was pretty smooth.I created the component 
for displaying images retrieved from the API and used a card-view to display the images on the virtual DOM.
The APP works absolutely fine.No errors at all.Please let me know if you have any issues with the app.

Once Again Thank you
